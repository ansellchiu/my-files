# Ansell's dotfiles and stuffs

This is still a work in progress.

## Install

1. clone `my-files/` down from repo
2. install `prezto` zsh library (like oh-my-zsh)
3. In your user home dir, symlink `.zpreztorc`, `.vimrc`, `.gitconfig`, and `.gitignore` to this repo's files.
4. install fonts
5. set iTerm 2 color scheme (currently using a modified `NightLion1` theme)
